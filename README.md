# TOP-Calculator

<h4> This is like the hardest project I've ever done so far. Figuring out the logic for the calculator was so difficult and I have not done the extra credit sections yet nor have I finished dealing with the CSS. </h4>

<h4> Originally, when i started i wanted the display to be more like the calculator we use in our phones, where we type in the full equation before pressing equal. That is why mine displays two digits instead of one. I think doing so actually added even more difficulties. </h4>

<h4>Also, there was a part where the string wasn't being sliced. I found out later that it was because the string had become a number and obviously now it couldn't be sliced.</h4>

<h4>The code is like super messy and many repititive parts. Anyway I just wanna move on to the next courses. </h4>
